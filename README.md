# oshwa_leaderboard_sorter
Short script for identifying top countries and entities from OSHWA registrations.

This repo does not include the actual data.  In that data the entity name is listed in the third column (column 2 if you are starting counting at 0) and country name is in the fifth column (column 4 if you are startign counting at 0).  It outputs two csv files, one of which lists the countries with certified hardware and the number of certifications and one that lists entities with certified hardware and the number of certifications.
